- 👋 Hi, I’m @AndreaCoul
- 👀 I’m interested in all things but, most recently, I want to get back into coding after stepping away many years ago having taken an IT Management path.
- 🌱 I’m currently re-learning web development and all the awesome advancements I have missed over the years.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web development once I get my legs back under me.
- 📫 How to reach me ... AndreaCoul on github, andrea.coulthart@gmail.com
